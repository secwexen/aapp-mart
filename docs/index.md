# AAPP‑MART Documentation

AAPP‑MART (Autonomous Agent & Predictive Processing Framework) is a modular AI-driven framework designed for autonomous agents, predictive task processing, and scalable tool integration.  
This documentation provides an overview of the framework’s architecture, components, and usage patterns.

---

## Getting Started

AAPP‑MART is built on a modular architecture consisting of the following layers:

- **Core** — Orchestrator, pipeline engine, task manager, knowledge graph, simulation engine  
- **Agents** — System, network, forensic, and custom autonomous agents  
- **Predictors** — Machine learning, rule-based, and hybrid predictive models  
- **Modules** — System, network, memory, automation, and controlled testing tools  
- **API** — REST and WebSocket interfaces  
- **CLI** — Command-line interface for interacting with the framework  
- **Utils** — Logging, configuration, validation helpers  
- **Data** — Sample datasets and model files  

---

## Installation

AAPP‑MART is currently under active development.  
Installation instructions will be added once the first stable release is available.

## Architecture Overview

AAPP‑MART is structured around three primary layers:

1. **Agent Layer**  
   Autonomous units responsible for executing tasks and interacting with modules.

2. **Predictive Processing Layer**  
   Models and logic that support decision-making and task prioritization.

3. **Modular Tool Layer**  
   System, network, memory, and automation tools used by agents.

These layers are coordinated by the **Orchestrator** and connected through the **Pipeline** system.
